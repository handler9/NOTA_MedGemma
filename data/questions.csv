Among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01). However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36). Which of the following explains for the difference observed between the two strata?""",Poor generalizability,Stratified sampling,Random error,Systematic error
